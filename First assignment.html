<H3>My personal IT profile</H3>
<p> My name is Jonathon Wallace. My student number is s3921371. My email address is s3921371@student.rmit.edu.au </p>
<p>My photo: <img src="photo of me.png" alt="Jono's photo" style="width:200px;height:250px;"> </p>

<p> I live in the Inner West of Sydney. I have worked in IT for a number of years as a product owner, business analyst and scrum master. 
I now work in telecommunications. I am married with one son, a six year old boy. </p>
<p> I have a bachelor's degree but I am returning to university study after many years and trying to balance that with full time work. 
I am a joint US/Australian citizen and I enjoy a number of different hobbies, including going to the gym, watching lots of different sports, reading and playing the occaisonal video game.</p>

<H5>Interest in IT</H5>
<p>I have been employed in IT for approximately 7 years. I have worked as a product owner, then a business analyst and finally as a scrum master. My roles have not involved software development directly, and I have undertaken this course to help enable me to learn how to become a software developer.</p>
<p>I became interested in IT from my workplace experiences. I began on working various projects that involved IT and became more and more fascinated. I made it a career goal to become involved. I have scrum mastered for large teams of developers and been involved in virtually every step of the process of software development, except for the actual software development itself. My commencing this degree is an attempt to close that gap.  </p>
<p>RMIT seemed like a good option as they have recieved a lot of good feedback about their online courses. I have no choice other than to complete the degree online, as I work full time and have a family and other obligations. Open Universities was my stepping stone into the degree here at RMIT.</p>
<p>I hope to slowly build up my ability to more directly involve my self in the software development cycle. I expect to remain as a Scrum Master, though who knows where the future will take me. Maybe at the end of my degree I'll move into software development itself.</p>

<p>An Agile coach is a senior role within the scrum/agile community. Rather than working at a team level, the agile coach drives change at an enterprise level. This position is one that I apsire to in coming years. It's a long term goal of mine</p>
<p>Aile coaches require several qualifications from certified organisations such as Scrum Alliance and Scaled Agile, Inc. Additionaly, it is expected that an Agile Coach will have many years experience as a Scrum Master and change agent within IT organisations or departments.</p>
<p>I have all of the requisite certifications (certified Scrum Master, certified SAFe Scrum Master, Scaled Agilist), though there are additional accreditations I could seek to help bolster my CV (Advanced Scrum Master for example) and the current Bachelors I am pursuing will no doubt help. I believe that I requirre a few more years experience as a Scrum Master, perhaps within different organisations and environments, before I'm ready to make the jump to Agile Coach</p>
<p>I will continue my accreditation pathway to obtain additional certifications, progress my Bachelor's of IT to bolster my technical knowledge and continue to pursue Scrum Master roles, to increase my real world experience.</p>

<H6>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</H6>
<p>These results reflect my basic understanding of myself, I believe. It's in line with my expectations for the most part. I believe it aligns with my career pathway and behaviour in day to day life.</p>

<H6>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</H6>
<p>I believe that these results reflect my behaviour in the teams I already work within and alongside. I truly believe in servant leadership, agility in the face of change and focusing on values like commitment, focus, openness, respect and courage.</p>

<H6>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</H6>
<p>I think that when forming a team, the key is to adapt the processes, methodologies and frameworks to the people. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses and so different personality types are to be celebrated, rather than accomodated, or worse, punished. In regards to my own traits, I believe that they already align with the roles I seek to fulfil in my career - servant leadership.</p>

<H2>Project Idea</H2>

<H3>Work/Life Balance application</H3>

<H4>Description</H4>
<p>The Work/Life balance application will offer the following key features to it's users:</p>

<H5>Feature 1: Calendar service</H5>
<p>A detailed, comprehensive calendar service, with the ability to schedule activities, block out time and track commitments. 
The calendar feature will allow users to schedule appointments, commitments and blocks of time to devote to activities. 
These periods of time will incorporate alarms and notifications services, both push and pull and will incorporate modern UX designs to allow users to navigate easily between options.</p>

<H5>Feature 2: Automation to enable time usage suggestions</H5>
<p>The application will utilize the use existing data gathered as users input their schedule to make smart suggestions.
 For example, if a user has repeatedly entered a regular meeting at a consistent time and/or location, this application will automatically suggest exactly when and where that meeting should take place. 
It will then recommend which type of meeting is to be scheduled and who to invite.
Using machine learning the application will determine when the best time for a user to work on specific tasks might be. 
It will suggest when the ideal time to send emails is based on past response rate. 
It will remind the user to schedule important appointments, such as medical visits or when it's time to prepare and submit a tax return for a given financial year.
</p>

<H5>Feature 3: Utilizing natural language processing to enable predictive text or faster navigation</H5>
<p>The application will utilize natural language processing to interpret the typed commands of users to help guide them through the use of the application. As users begin scheduling meetings, the tool will assist by interpreting the content of the meeting and suggesting attendees, locations or times for the meeting. Navigation will be assisted by allowing the user to simply type commands such as 'next month' or 'the following Tuesday' triggering the navigation to take them to the appropriate part of the calendar. Predictive text will enable the application to offer drop down selections of suggested times, locations or activities when scheduling.</p>

<H5>Feature 4: Integration with other applications</H5>
<p>The application will be enabled to integrate with a wide variety of software based tools, including web based video conferencing applications, fitness apps, community activity tracking apps, social engagement applications and all major types of email services. This will allow for seamless navigation between tools, and the ability to schedule meetings and activities directly from the application into the relevant downstream tool or service.
If a user wants to quickly schedule a catch up online with friends, they can do so from the application and the meeting will be scheduled and invitations sent to downstream users.

This reporting will enable the user to make smarter decisions about future time management.</p>


<H4>Tools and Technologies</H4>
<p>The application will utilize a number of tools and technologies.
At it's core, the application will be a mobile and web based software application. It will use APIs, automation and software languages to create a single page front end application connected to various downstream services. Data will be stored in a cloud based data warehouse or database.
Languages such as Python, JavaScript, PHP, and others would appropriate for this application. A software development environment such as AWS Cloud9 would be an appropriate service to integrate various tools, applications and code bases.
In addition, GitHub would be crucial to coordinate the CI/CD pipeline and serve as a collaboration hub for all code branches and features. A tool such as confluence or Jira might also serve useful to track the work across well defined time-boxes</p>

<H4>Skills Required</H4>
<p>Various software skills will be required, including familiarity with relevant code languages, the use of AWS and Github and the appropriate controls around feature branching, code mergers and maintenance of the central repository.
The creation of APIs (including well defined swagger documents, and the ability to integrate APIs across various tools and systems) will be crucial to the project.
A knowledge of database structures and languages such as SQL will be imperative.
Additionally good Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery practices will need to be followed to ensure the project is a success.
Finally, the successful delivery of the application would require good project management skills and discipline.</p>

<H4>Outcome</H4>
<p>The successful delivery of the application will be measured by the meeting of specified acceptance criteria.
This acceptance criteria will be crafted and adjusted throughout the project delivery process in response to frequent engagement with potential and future customers and the resultant customer feedback loop.
Potential acceptance criteria would include:
The uptake of the tool by potential users.
The self-reported satisfaction with the tool as measured in direct workshop engagements with users and through tools such as Net-Promoter Score.
